If we were to believe the headlines in the news, robots will take over our jobs, while AI is on course ot redefine art and creativity. But do we really have the powers to predict the future, what are these headlines if not attempts to predict the unpredictable? Electric tarot is a somewhat ironic and playful take on the idea of divination - <b>do not</b> take it seriously!  We invite you to use a virtual deck of cards to gain insight into yourself, your possible futures and your quests. Each card is rich in symbolism, representing various aspects of living with digital technologies in the age of climate crisis. Tarot readings provide a unique opportunity to explore the hidden realms of the subconscious mind and tap into universal energies. The inherent flexibility and interpretive nature of tarot make it an excellent tool for exploring one's psyche and connecting with the mystical forces that shape our lives.
<br><br>
<strong>How to do a tarot reading:</strong><br>
Close your eyes, lay your hands flat on the table and let the machine shuffle the virtual deck and infuse it with your energy. Then, formulate a clear question about your fortune, and press the button to draw your cards. Our tarot machine will help you to interpret their symbolism and positions in the spread with detailed readings once you click on each card. Finally, reflect on the messages conveyed, considering relationships between the cards, and take note of any insights gained for personal reflection and potential actions to take. The machine will then delete your question and reading.
